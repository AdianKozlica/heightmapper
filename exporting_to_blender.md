To use a heightmap from Heightmapper as a displacement map in Blender:

Enter the following keys, in order â€“ make sure your cursor is over the main viewport before you begin.

1. Start with a new scene.

2. Delete the startup cube:
 - `x`
 - `return`

3. Create a grid:
 - `shift-a`
 - `m`
 - `g`

4. Enter number of divisions (this can be any number, but these steps will make one vertex per pixel in the heightmap) (click nowhere! just start typing):
 - enter number of x pixels in heightmap minus 2
 - `tab`
 - enter number of y pixels in heightmap minus 2

5. Scale to match image:
 - `s`
 - enter the number of x pixels / 1000
 - `tab`
 - enter y pixels / 1000
 - `tab`
 - enter `1` (for z-scale)
 - `return`

6. Add displacement modifier:
 - tools menu (wrench)
 - "add modifier"
 - deform > displace
 - texture: new
 - "show texture in texture tab" - far right button
 - "open"
 - select file

7. Scale displacement:
 - select displacement modifier
 - edit scale
 - set scale to be x-scale * "z:x scale factor"

### Printing

To print, export to `.obj` or `.stl`.

When preparing a model for 3D printing I like to fade the edges out, to ensure that the edges will be the lowest part of the model. You can do this with the square gradient tool in Photoshop.

### Tips

The first time you try this, it's convenient to make your heightmap 1000 pixels wide, which makes the math easier: then your mesh x-scale is just 1, and your displacement scale is the "z:x scale factor" value copied from the Heightmapper.

Good luck!
